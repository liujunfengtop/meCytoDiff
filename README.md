# meCytoDiff:a tool for differential analysis of RNA-BisSeq data at alternative isoform level
meCytoDiff is a program for analysis of RNA-BisSeq data for which the methylation state of individual cytosine was obtained from the RNA-BisSeq data mapping tool, such as the mapper of Episo, the meRanCall of meRanTK and BS-RAN. meCytoDiff runs from the command line at linux or unix platform. Meanwhile, gcc (C-compatible compiler) and a kind of mapping tool for bisulfited RNA-Seq (RNA-BisSeq) data are needed to be installed on your computer. meCytoDiff can be downloaded from the meCytoDiff homepage. The details see the document meCytoDiff_User_Guide.pdf.
